## Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence or cyber threat intelligence is the process of identifying and analyzing gathered information about past, current, and future cyber threats (Collecting information about a potential threat, then analyzing that information to learn more about the negative events)

## Steps
#### Planning & Direction

#### Collection
Collect data from multiple sources
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- Social Media Intelligence (SOCMINT)
- Human Intelligence (HUMINT)
- Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)
- Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT)
- Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)
- Technical Intelligence (TECHINT)
- Imagery Intelligence (IMINT)
- Financial Intelligence (FININT)

#### Processing
Convert the gathered raw data into an readable\usable format (Remove false positive and structure the data)

#### Analysis & Production
Evaluate the structured data and create actionable information based on the requirements specified in the Planning step.
